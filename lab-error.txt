Hello, I've been unable to complete the following lab for three days now:

Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate > Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques > Debugging and Solving Software Problems

The script is referencing a resource that is unavailable at the following URL:
http://marga.com.ar/employees-with-date.csv

I've contacted Chat Support twice and told they are working on it and are unable to give any ETA, was told this is impacting all users and can reference ticket# 1776086

Can someone please explain what's going on or what's being done to resolve?
